# gumtree_crawler

This is an interesting example program about how to extract information from website.

The expample applied a random Gumtree page and extract information about:
   1.each item's single url link;
   2.each item's title;
   3.each item's condition (used or new)
   
However this is not a universal program, it is necessary to open the web page you interested in and inspect the element and edit your Python file.
